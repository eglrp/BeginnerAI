def convert_coordinates(tensor, start_index, conversion, border_pixels='half'):
    '''
    Convert coordinates for axis-aligned 2D boxes between two coordinate formats.

    Creates a copy of `tensor`, i.e. does not operate in place. Currently there are
    three supported coordinate formats that can be converted from and to each other:
        1) (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) - the 'minmax' format
        2) (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) - the 'corners' format
        2) (cx, cy, w, h) - the 'centroids' format

    Arguments:
        tensor (array): A Numpy nD array containing the four consecutive coordinates
            to be converted somewhere in the last axis.
        start_index (int): The index of the first coordinate in the last axis of `tensor`.
        conversion (str, optional): The conversion direction. Can be 'minmax2centroids',
            'centroids2minmax', 'corners2centroids', 'centroids2corners', 'minmax2corners',
            or 'corners2minmax'.
        border_pixels (str, optional): How to treat the border pixels of the bounding boxes.
            Can be 'include', 'exclude', or 'half'. If 'include', the border pixels belong
            to the boxes. If 'exclude', the border pixels do not belong to the boxes.
            If 'half', then one of each of the two horizontal and vertical borders belong
            to the boxex, but not the other.

    Returns:
        A Numpy nD array, a copy of the input tensor with the converted coordinates
        in place of the original coordinates and the unaltered elements of the original
        tensor elsewhere.

    Matches all elements along the second axis of `weight_matrix` to their best

    If the weight matrix contains elements that should be ignored, the row or column

    Arguments:

    combinations of the boxes in `boxes1` and `boxes2`.

    In 'element-wise' mode, `m` and `n` must be broadcast-compatible. Refer to the explanation

    Arguments:
        boxes1 (array): Either a 1D Numpy array of shape `(4, )` containing the coordinates for one box in the
            format specified by `coords` or a 2D Numpy array of shape `(m, 4)` containing the coordinates for `m` boxes.
            If `mode` is set to 'element_wise', the shape must be broadcast-compatible with `boxes2`.

            If `mode` is set to 'element_wise', the shape must be broadcast-compatible with `boxes1`.
        coords (str, optional): The coordinate format in the input arrays. Can be either 'centroids' for the format
            `(cx, cy, w, h)`, 'minmax' for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format

            `n` boxes in `boxes2`. In 'element-wise' mode, returns a 1D array and the shapes of `boxes1` and `boxes2`

            length `m` where the i-th position contains the IoU overlap of `boxes1[i]` with `boxes2[i]`.

    anchor box will be matched first, then out of the remaining ground
    truth boxes, the ground truth box that has the greatest similarity
    with any of the remaining anchor boxes will be matched second, and
    so on. That is, the ground truth boxes will be matched in descending
    order by maximum similarity with any of the respectively remaining
    anchor boxes.
    The runtime complexity is O(m^2 * n), where `m` is the number of
